| Label | Association
| Definition | An activity association is an assignment of responsibility to an agent for an activity, indicating that the agent had a role in the activity. It further allows for a plan to be specified, which is the plan intended by the agent to achieve some goals in the context of this activity.

| Scope note | Associate an agent to an activity (`tern:Sampling`, `tern:Observation`) with a role from link:http://def.isotc211.org/iso19115/-1/2018/CitationAndResponsiblePartyInformation/code/CI_RoleCode[ISO 19115-1's CI Role Code].

| Definition | An agent is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity.
| Scope note | 
| Implementation | A `prov:Association` _MUST_ have exactly 1 `prov:agent` predicate where the value node is an IRI of an individual with the type `prov:Agent`.

| Label | had plan
| Definition | A plan is an entity that represents a set of actions or steps intended by one or more agents to achieve some goals.
| Scope note | Associate a plan to the agent which they use for their role in some activity. This may or may not be the same as the procedure of a `tern:Sampling` or a `tern:Observation` depending on the role of the agent.
| Implementation | A `prov:Association` _MAY_ have some `prov:hadPlan` predicate where the value node is an IRI.
